1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
   - Rigorous testing is one of the best ways to ensure this. Testing can catch the errors and bugs within your program and make it more efficient and secure.
2. How do i interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
   - This is achieved by defining what exactly the user wants through the use of requirements and user stories and implement features within your prorgam that satisfy the user's desires.
3. How do I approach designing software?
   - I think designing software is best approached with the mindset of solving a problem as efficiently as possible. Programs may have many "problems" that need to be solved along with constraints on how they can be solved, but that's what it mostly is to me: solving problems and making programs that serve roles.
